# Release Rules

## Release Process
- We use semantic versioning (e.g., v0.0.3, v1.0.0, v2.1.4)
- Releases are triggered by creating Git tags with 'v' prefix
- Release pipeline automatically builds and publishes Docker images to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
- Version information is automatically updated in frontend during release

## How to Create a Release
1. **Commit all changes** to main branch
2. **Create and push a tag** with version format:
   ```bash
   git tag v0.0.3
   git push origin v0.0.3
   ```
3. **Release pipeline automatically**:
   - Extracts version from tag (removes 'v' prefix)
   - Updates `frontend/src/version.ts` with production version
   - Builds Docker images for both backend and frontend
   - Pushes images to GHCR with version tag and 'latest' tag
   - Creates release summary with Docker image links

## Version Management
- Local development uses 'X.X.X-local' version format
- Production releases use semantic versioning without 'v' prefix in version.ts
- Docker images are tagged with both specific version and 'latest'
- Kubernetes deployments should reference specific version tags, not 'latest'

## Docker Images Location
- Backend: `ghcr.io/sekretk/delbot/backend:v0.0.3`
- Frontend: `ghcr.io/sekretk/delbot/frontend:v0.0.3`
- Repository is public, no authentication required for pulling images

## Deployment After Release
1. Wait for release pipeline to complete
2. Deploy using version-specific deployment:
   ```bash
   cd k8s && ./deploy-version.sh 0.0.3
   ```
3. Verify deployment and version display on frontend
